# Machine Learning Algorithm Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that visualizes a machine learning algorithm using linear regression on advertising data. The script reads the "Advertising.csv" dataset, trains a linear regression model, and provides a visual representation of the relationship between TV advertising budgets and sales.


## About the Project

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of a linear regression algorithm on advertising data. The script utilizes the "Advertising.csv" dataset to predict sales based on TV advertising expenditure and visualizes the linear regression model's predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "Advertising.csv", which contains information about advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- plotly

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-visualization.git
cd machine-learning-visualization
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the visualization script, execute the following command:

```bash
python visualize_ml_algorithm.py
```

## Visualization

The visualization generated by the script includes:

- A scatter plot displaying the relationship between TV advertising budgets and sales.
- A linear regression line representing the predicted sales based on the trained linear regression model.
